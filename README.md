# TokenManager - Asset Tokenization on Solana

> A lightweight Solana program for tokenizing assets with ISIN identifiers and transfer restrictions using SPL Token-2022's transfer hooks.

TokenManager is a tokenization project built on Solana that helps with digitizing financial assets. It uses SPL Token 2022 features to implement basic transfer rules and whitelist functionality.

## Features

- **Asset Tokenization** - Create tokens with ISIN identifiers
- **Whitelist Functionality** - Basic validation for token transfers
- **SPL Token 2022 Integration** - Uses token metadata and transfer hooks
- **Basic Access Control** - Manage which wallets can receive tokens
- **Token Minting** - Issue tokens to specified accounts

## Potential Use Cases

- **Security Tokens** - Issue tokens with transfer restrictions
- **Fund Tokenization** - Basic representation of fund shares
- **Digital Asset Management** - Create and manage tokens with identifiers

## Technical Components

TokenManager uses:
- Anchor Framework
- SPL Token 2022
- Transfer hook validation
- Program Derived Addresses (PDAs)

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Solana CLI tools
- Rust and Cargo
- Node.js and npm
- Anchor Framework

### Installation

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/your-username/token-manager.git
cd token-manager

# Install dependencies
npm install

# Build the Rust program
anchor build

# Deploy to localnet for testing
anchor deploy
```

### Running Tests

```bash
# Start a local Solana validator
solana-test-validator

# Run the test suite
anchor test
```

## How It Works

1. **Token Creation** - Create tokens with ISIN codes
2. **Whitelist Management** - Control which addresses can receive tokens
3. **Transfer Validation** - Check if receiving wallets are whitelisted
4. **Token Minting** - Issue tokens to approved wallets

## Current Security Features

- Transfer validation with whitelists
- Basic authority checks
- PDA-based account security

## Future Development Ideas

- KYC/AML integration
- Multi-signature support
- Dividend distribution
- Additional transfer rule options
